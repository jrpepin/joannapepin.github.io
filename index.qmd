Joanna Pepin is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology at the University of Toronto, where she is also a faculty affiliate at the Centre for Global Social Policy. Prior to this position, she was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology at the University at Buffalo (SUNY) and a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Population Research Center at the University of Texas - Austin.

Dr. Pepin’s research focuses on family demography, gender inequality, and social change. Her work explores how gender norms and economic structures shape intimate relationships, such as attitudes and behaviors related to marriage, divisions of household labor, whether couples pool their earnings, and work-family arrangements across generations. Dr. Pepin’s current projects investigate what constitutes an "equal" relationship and how work, family, and gender beliefs relate to mental health. Pepin’s research has appeared in the *American Sociological Review*, *American Journal of Sociology*, *Demography*, and *Journal of Marriage and Family.* It has been covered by news outlets such as the *New York Times, Washington Post, Time Magazine, and The Guardian*.

\* Speaking with journalists and non-profits are the priority in Pepin's commitment to public sociology. All others interested in a consultation, please inquire to discuss the financial terms.
