Prior to this position, she was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology at the University at Buffalo (SUNY) and a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Population Research Center at the University of Texas - Austin.\nAs a family sociologist, she studies inequality as it is woven through couple and family relations. Her current research examines trends in attitudes and behaviors related to the distribution of resources within families, such as who does the housework, who works for pay, and how couples share (or don’t share) earnings and family responsibilities.\nAnother research stream explores how historical time and place contribute to gender inequality within families and the growing divergence in outcomes among women.\nPepin’s research has appeared in the American Sociological Review, Journal of Marriage and Family and Demography and it has been covered by news outlets such as the New York Times, Washington Post, Time Magazine, and The Guardian.\n* Speaking with journalists and non-profits are the priority in Pepin’s commitment to public sociology.

You will finish the course with a better understanding of the differences between families and the ways that social forces shape families. You will apply the sociological perspective to the institution of the family and examine how social factors such as race, class, and gender shape contemporary families. By the end of this course, students should be able to:\n\nUnderstand and evaluate the family as a socially and culturally constructed institution.\nThink critically about how race, class, gender, age, and social location shape how individuals experience family life within society.\nHave an awareness of historical and demographic trends shape and change family patterns in American society.\nBe able to form arguments and think critically about family life and broader society."

Detailed instructions about developing appropriate quiz questions will be provided.\nThe Flipped Quizzes have suggested completion dates followed by a hard deadline. The suggested deadline for each quiz is the end of week the topic was covered in class. The hard deadline for the quizzes correspond with the tests and fact check paper deadlines. Two quizzes are due by Test 1, two quizzes are due by Test 2, and one quiz is due by the end of the term (same due date as the final paper). This is meant to provide a structured schedule for students who want that, but also flexibility over the course of the semester as disruptions may arise.\nQuiz content may only be used from modules that correspond with the upcoming test (or final paper). For example, you can’t use content from Week 2 after Test 1 has already passed or content from week 8 after Test 2.\n\n\nTests\nThere will be 2 tests over the course of the semester, available for a 48 hour window encompassing the class time noted on the schedule. Tests will be available on Quercus allowing each student to take the test from any location. Once started, students will have two hours to complete the test\nWhile students cannot consult each other regarding the test, the tests are considered “open book.” The purpose of the tests are not to evaluate memorization but familiarity with theories, concepts, trends, and approaches to understanding families. Tests be a mix of multiple choice, short answer, and essay questions. All materials in this course (i.e., readings, lectures, videos, and discussions) are considered “fair game” for test questions.\n\n\nFact Check Paper\nYou will be asked to write a 1500-2000 word examination of a claim you find in the media related to a course topic. Think of this as a writing assignment structured as: “I read that XXXX, but in reality the research says YYYY.”\nAdditional assignment details will be provided later in the course. The late deduction is 5% for each 24-hour period the assignment is late starting with the day the assignment is due."

    "text": "Do you accept late assignments?\nFlipped quizzes are not accepted after the hard deadline. For example, a Flipped Quiz on Families and Social Class may not be submitted after Test 1. The final (fifth) flipped quiz is due at the same time as the fact check paper. It is in students’ best interest to front-load completion of the flipped quizzes when possible, such as planning to complete quizzes for weeks 2 and 3, so that a quiz for week 4 can be used as a backup if an unforeseen circumstance arises.\nTests have non-negotiable due dates. The late deduction for the Fact Check Paper is 5% for each 24-hour period the assignment is late starting with the day the assignment is due. For example, an assignment submitted 12 hours late would receive a 5% late penalty, an assignment submitted 25 hours would receive a 10% late deduction. No work will be accepted more than 2 weeks past the original due date.\nStudents who miss a test, or are late in submitting an assignment for medical reasons, need to declare their absence on the system (ACORN) and email the instructor (not the TA). Students who miss the test, or are late in submitting an assignment for other reasons, such as family or other personal reasons, should request their College Registrar email the instructor.\nBe aware that assignment closing dates and deadlines are automated within Quercus. For example, if something is due at 11:59pm on Mar 1st, it will be marked late if it is submitted at 12:00am on Mar 2nd, and if an assignment is set to close (i.e., late assignment is not accepted) at 11:59pm on Mar 1st, Quercus will not accept submissions at 12:00am on Mar 2nd. I will not provide extensions due to slow internet, connectivity issues, or other technical delays that result in submission after the deadline. Start the submission process well enough in advance to ensure that your paper will be fully submitted before the deadline"

Thus, it is possible that when your assignment is re-examined, your grade might be lowered.\nAny questions about grading an assignment or test must be raised within two weeks of the date that the assignment was graded.

Therefore, all assignments submitted though Quercus may be subject to Ouriginal review. It uses text matching technology as a method to uphold the University’s high academic integrity standards to detect any potential plagiarism. In doing so, students will allow their essays to be included as source documents in the tool’s reference database, where they will be used solely for the purpose of detecting plagiarism. The terms that apply to the University’s use of this tool are described on the website for the Centre for Teaching Support & Innovation.\nIf students prefer their work not be subject to Ouriginal review, they must notify the instructor at least 48 hours before the assignment deadline to arrange an alternative submission through Quercus AND provide, sufficient secondary material (e.g., reading notes, outlines of the paper, rough drafts of the final draft, etc.) to establish that the work they submit is truly their own. The alternative is in place because, strictly speaking, using Ouriginal is voluntary for students at the University of Toronto.\nPlagiarism: Be careful to avoid plagiarism. It is a serious academic offense with serious penalties (see the Code of Behavior on Academic Matters). Do not present someone else’s ideas as your own. Give proper references to others’ ideas, and use quotation marks if you are quoting. When in doubt, err on the side of a reference. Turning in an old paper, or large parts thereof, for credit in a second (or third etc.) course, is considered an academic offense that results in students being referred off to the Office of Academic Integrity."

There will be quizzes, short in-class writing assignments and data exercises, and collaboratively discussing and then answering a series of questions related to the course readings and the lecture content. The activities make take place at the beginning, middle or near the end of lecture. There will be 11 of these in-class activities, each worth 2%. Your lowest grade will be dropped from inclusion of your final in-class activity grade (even if it is a zero).\n\n\nTest 1 (25%) and Test 2 (25%)\nThere will be 2 tests over the course of the semester, available for a 48 hour window encompassing the class time noted on the schedule. Tests will be available on Quercus allowing each student to take the exam from any location. Once started, students will have two hours to complete the test\nWhile students cannot consult each other regarding the exam, the tests are considered “open book.” The purpose is the tests are not to evaluate memorization but familiarity with theories, concepts, trends and approaches to understanding romantic relationships. Tests be a mix of multiple choice, short answer, and essay questions and all materials in this course (i.e., readings, lectures, videos, and discussions) are considered “fair game” for test questions.\n\n\nTwo Options for the remaining 30%\nStudents get to choose whether they want the remaining 30% to come from one semester long term paper assignment, or a series of smaller assignments, submitted throughout the semester.\n\nOption 1: Paper & Slides (30%)\nThe term paper and slides are a substantive engagement with a topic raised in one of the course readings, subject to approval. The term paper and presentation slides is a staged semi-structured assignment, with opportunities to get feedback on the way towards a final paper.\nThe slides consist of 8 to 10 powerpoint slides summarizing your research question and findings on the topic. The final paper needs to be 3500 words in length. You can also take this opportunity to work in collaboration with a colleague in which case you need to write a 4500 words paper.\nStage 1: Proposal (2.5%)\nThe first stage involves a two page proposal laying out the topic you propose on writing a term paper on, the research question you plan on answering, and a tentative title for your projected paper. This stage is completed to ascertain the suitability and feasibility of your topic and its alignment with the course objectives.\nStage 2: Submission of slides (7.5%)\nThe second stage is the submission of your powerpoint slides (uploaded as a .pptx or .pdf to Quercus page). This is done both as a way for students to communicate effectively their hard work to their peers, and to receive feedback on them in order to help with the final write-up.\nStage 3: Submission of final write-up (20%) The final stage is the submission of the term paper, one digital copy through Quercus & Turnitin. Late penalty is 10% per day.\nEach stage is mandatory. You cannot move to the next stage without completing the previous one. While these are the only mandatory stages, you are highly encouraged to communicate with your TA several times in the semester and to sit down and chat with them at various point to get further guidance and feedback on the term paper. Further details will be discussed in the early weeks of the semester. A more detailed description of the assignment will be distributed separately.\n\n\nOption 2: Interview Project (20%)\nStudents will interview someone about their thoughts on a specific aspect of intimate relationships and then write up a summary and analysis of the interview, connecting it to course readings (2000-2500 words in length).\nStage 1: Semi-structured Interview Protocol (2.5%)\nStage 2: Interview Transcript (2.5%)\nStage 3: Submission of final write-up (15%) The final stage is the submission of the term paper, one digital copy through Quercus & Turnitin. Late penalty is 10% per day.\nEach stage is mandatory. You cannot move to the next stage without completing the previous one. While these are the only mandatory stages, you are highly encouraged to communicate with your TA several times in the semester and to sit down and chat with them at various point to get further guidance and feedback on the term paper. Further details will be discussed in the early weeks of the semester. A more detailed description of the assignment will be distributed separately.\n\n\nAND Five Critical Reflections of the News (10%)\nThese 250-350 word assignments involve engaging critically with a specified week’s readings and making connections between them and the real world. Students will locate a news article connected to a lecture topic, briefly summarize the content of the article, and critically reflect on it. These reflections can take many forms, such as fact checking (The news says X, but our class readings say Y), evaluating a new research finding getting media attention, using an event (such as celebrity relationship gossip) as a case study to highlight the significance of the course materials or new questions raised. All essays must make a clear argument, demonstrate understanding of the class readings, and appropriately apply the class material. Do not use quotes from the readings for this, but instead use entirely your own words.\nEach student choosing option 2 will submit five of these over the semester, worth 2% each, and they are due the Friday before the topic is discussed in class.Note: CRs will never be accepted late. If you cannot submit it on time, then you can complete one(s) that is/are due the following week."
