Prior to this position, she was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology at the University at Buffalo (SUNY) and a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Population Research Center at the University of Texas - Austin.\nAs a family sociologist, she studies inequality as it is woven through couple and family relations. Her current research examines trends in attitudes and behaviors related to the distribution of resources within families, such as who does the housework, who works for pay, and how couples share (or don’t share) earnings and family responsibilities.\nAnother research stream explores how historical time and place contribute to gender inequality within families and the growing divergence in outcomes among women.\nPepin’s research has appeared in the American Sociological Review, Journal of Marriage and Family and Demography and it has been covered by news outlets such as the New York Times, Washington Post, Time Magazine, and The Guardian.\n* Speaking with journalists and non-profits are the priority in Pepin’s commitment to public sociology. All others interested in a consultation, please inquire to discuss the financial terms."

Detailed instructions about developing appropriate quiz questions will be provided.\nTwo quizzes are due by Test 1, two quizzes are due by Test 2, and one quiz is due by the end of the term (same due date as the final paper). Quiz content may only be used from modules that correspond with the upcoming exam (or final paper). For example, you can’t use content from Week 2 after Test 1 has already passed or content from week 8 after Test 2.\n\n\nTests\nThere will be 2 tests over the course of the semester during the class times noted on the schedule. Tests will be open book and will not be cumulative but all materials in this course (i.e., readings, lectures, videos, and discussions) are considered “fair game.”\nTests will be available on Quercus and will be a mix of multiple choice and short answer questions. You will have two hours to complete each test.\n\n\nFact Check Paper\nYou will be asked to write a 500-1500 word examination of a claim you find in the media related to a course topic. Think of this as a writing assignment structured as: “I read that XXXX, but in reality the research says YYYY.”\nAdditional assignment details will be provided later in the course."
